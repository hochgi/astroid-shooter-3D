|TODO LIST|
-----------

* GPanel: implement top for ship. not absolute

* motherShip should be collidable... don't allow to fly through it...

* try to replace the newlyBorn+graveyard+working Lists with concurent (blocking) lists implementation

* make sprite rendering to not generate too many Vector instances

* make collidables to not generate too many Bounding_?_ instances

-DONE!- implement cross product, instead of using javax.vecmath's

* splash screens: choose M-Model or G-Model battle craft.

-DONE!- implement obj/3ds file loader in Model3D class.

-DONE!- model and texture of the ships & the asteroids.

-DONE!- implement particles engine, and use shooting with particles (random spray factor?)

* think about michael's idea. to have a ground (city? several buildings?) we need to protect.
  asteroids will only come from above. 
  
-DONE!- convert all double calculations to float for efficiency.

-DONE!- Spark: all attributes vary a bit. alpha, size, velocity, direction (very small change delta)

* add comments!

-DONE!- update of renderable elements should take place on a different thread, with timertask scheduling
  since render loop slows down a lot when there's many heavy stuff to draw...

-DONE!- finish with explosion effect (flying sparks, smoke trails, round sparks)

-DONE!- implement a secondary weapon. the one we already made should be the "heavy artillery", 
  		and the old particle_32X32.png should be a light weapon (a single shot = single particle)
  		so it won't be heavy on the render...

-DONE!- implement "cool off" for weapons. we don't want high rate off firing that would burden the game.

-DONE!- implement Collidable interface for whatever objects we want (including Shot)

-DONE!- build the scene

* implement help splash screen on F1 hits

* build a nice looking status bar. minimap should show asteroid movement from top view, 
  turning red as they getting near the ground.
  
-DONE!- LineSprites should return only the projection of the billboard, and not the billboard itself,
  		since it intersects with the orthogonal to camera point sprites.
  
-DONE!- fix synchronization problems when rotating the ship.
  
* Game Logic:
    - only allow to carry 3 rockets at a time.
    - flying through the hangar should reload rockets.
    - hangar should allow docking and to change the ship being used while docked.
    - add points / score of destroyed asteroids.
    - end game when an asteroid hits earth.
    - add atmosphere to earth, preventing the ship to get too close to earth.
    - an asteroid should be vanquished when it's being hit by 1 rocket, or 10 regular shots.
    -DONE!- use splines to iteratively get the rocket closer to an asteroid. (homing rocket - always hits the target)
