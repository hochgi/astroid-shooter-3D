|TODO LIST|
-----------

* implement cross product, instead of using javax.vecmath's

* splash screens: choose M-Model or G-Model battle craft.

* implement obj/3ds file loader in Model3D class.

* model and texture of the ships & the asteroids.

-DONE!- implement particles engine, and use shooting with particles (random spray factor?)

* think about michael's idea. to have a ground (city? several buildings?) we need to protect.
  asteroids will only come from above. 
  
-DONE!- convert all double calculations to float for efficiency.

-DONE!- Spark: all attributes vary a bit. alpha, size, velocity, direction (very small change delta)

* add comments!

* update of renderable elements should take place on a different thread, with timertask scheduling
  since render loop slows down a lot when there's many heavy stuff to draw...

* finish with explosion effect (flying sparks, smoke trails, round sparks)

* implement a secondary weapon. the one we already made should be the "heavy artillery", 
  and the old particle_32X32.png should be a light weapon (a single shot = single particle)
  so it won't be heavy on the render...

* implement "cool off" for weapons. we don't want high rate off firing that would burden the game.

* implement Collidable interface for whatever objects we want (including Shot)

* build the scene

* implement help splash screen on F1 hits

* build a nice looking status bar. minimap should show asteroid movement from top view, 
  turning red as they getting near the ground.
