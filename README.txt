Extras:
  1. we added some interesting items in the room:
     4 cubes, each rotating about a different axis,
     and a tetrahedron on the ceiling, which is also rotating.

  2. we added a button which says "RCR",
     and as you can see from the button tooltip,
     it stands for "Reverse Cubes Rotation".

  3. we added a button which says "ICC",
     and as you can see from the button tooltip,
     it stands for "Inverse Cubes Color".
     
  4. we added a button which says "CTS",
     and as you can see from the button tooltip,
     it stands for "Change Tetrahedron Speed".
     
  5. we added a button which says "RCO",
     and as you can see from the button tooltip,
     it stands for "Reset Camera Orientation".
     
  6. we added a minimap to show where you stand.
     it's responsive, so test it (like leaving the
     area covered by the map or reentering it)
